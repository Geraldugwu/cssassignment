    <h1>WHAT IS BLOCKCHAIN TECHNOLOGY?</h1>
    <P class="explanation">Blockchain technology is a distributed ledger technology that allows digital information to be shared among a network of users without the need for a central authority. A blockchain is essentially a decentralized database that is maintained by a network of nodes. Each node has a copy of the database, and all transactions are verified by the network before they are added to the database.</P>
    <h2>HOW DOES BLOCKCHAIN TECHNOLOGY WORK?</h2>
    <P id="how">At its core, a blockchain is a series of blocks, each containing a record of transactions. Each block contains a unique code, known as a hash, that identifies it. The hash of each block is generated using the hash of the previous block, which creates a chain of blocks, hence the name "blockchain."</P>
